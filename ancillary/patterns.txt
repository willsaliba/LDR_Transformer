1
(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)
?i:              = case insensistive
[sdmt]|ll|ve|re  = splits: s, d, m, t, ll, ve, re, 

2
[^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?+\p{L}+
[^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?+   = zero/one occurances of any char except \r, \n, letter, number
\p{L}+                = one or more Unicode letters

3
\p{N}{1,3}
\p{N}   = any number
{1,3}   = one to three occurances

4
 ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]++[\r\n]*
?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]++   = matches zero/one space followed by one or more characters that aren't whitespace/letters/numbers
[\r\n]*              = zero or more newlines

5
\s*[\r\n]
matches zero or more spaces followed by a newline 

6
\s+(?!\S)
\s+     = one or more spaces
(?!\S)  = negative lookahead, ensures no non-whitespace character follows

7
\s+
matches one or more whitespaces

re_pattern = r"(?i)([sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|([^\r\n\w]?+[a-zA-Z]+)|(\d{1,3})|(\s?[^\s\w]++[\r\n]*)|(\s*[\r\n])|(\s+(?!\S))|(\s+)"

1
(?i)([sdmt]|ll|ve|re)
diff: change syntax, no compromise

2
[^\r\n\w]?+[a-zA-Z]+
diff: re doesnt support unicode properties, so use \w & a-zA-z to encompass all letters, digits, underscores

3
\d{1,3}
diff: both cover digits, may not handle unicode numeric values besides 0-9, (maybe stuff like pi)

4
\s?[^\s\w]++[\r\n]*
diff: combination of 2 and 3

5
\s*[\r\n]
diff: none

6
\s+(?!\S)
diff: none

7
\s+
diff: none
